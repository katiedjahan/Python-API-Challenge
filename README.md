# Python-API-Challenge
Module 6 API Challenge

This repository consists of a WeatherPy folder which contains the WeatherPy.ipynb file, VacationPy.ipynb file, and output_data folder.


# WeatherPy.ipynb
This file contains the Python script written in Jupyter Notebook and contains all of the analysis and results for the WeatherPy portion of the assignment.

Requirement 1 utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a randomized list of cities and scatter plots are created.

Linear regressions are performed on the scatter plots for Requirement 2.


# VacationPy.ipynb
This file contains the Python script written in Jupyter Notebook and contains all of the analysis and results for the VacationPy portion of the assignment.

This file contains map plots and utilizes the Geoapify API to find hotels near specific coordinates.

# output_data
This folder contains screenshots of the four scatter plots created for Requirement 1 in WeatherPy.ipynb. It also contains the cities.csv file which holds the data for the randomized cities analyzed in WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb.
